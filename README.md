Your guide to modern web development best practices

**Website:** [https://ahworks.xyz/docs](https://ahworks.xyz/docs)

## 🎯 What is Webdocs?

Webdocs is not a component library - it's a comprehensive guide that shows you how to use existing tools and libraries the right way. We demonstrate how to connect real components, utilities, and architecture patterns together to build scalable, consistent web applications.

## ✨ What Webdocs Solves

Most UI libraries stop at visuals. Webdocs goes further:

- Real working examples connected to backend data
- Unified folder structures for maintainable codebases
- Scalable solutions for form handling, theming, and internationalization
- Best practices for performance, security, and developer experience
