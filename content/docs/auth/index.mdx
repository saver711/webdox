## What You'll Learn

Secure authentication implementation for modern web applications. No theory, just working solutions.

**For developers who**: Understand JWT and HTTP basics, want production-ready code, need permission-based access control.

---

## The Security Threats

### 🔴 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

Malicious JavaScript steals tokens from `localStorage`.

**Example**: Third-party script gets compromised → Reads your tokens → Sends to attacker.

**Impact**: Complete account takeover.

---

### 🔴 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Malicious site tricks browser into making authenticated requests.

**Example**: User visits evil.com → Form submits to your API → Browser sends cookies automatically.

**Impact**: Unauthorized actions (money transfer, data deletion).

---

### 🔴 Token Theft

Long-lived tokens stolen once = permanent access.

**Impact**: Attacker uses token even after vulnerability is fixed.

---

## The Solutions

Both guides solve these with:

- **httpOnly cookies** - XSS protection
- **Short access tokens** - Limit damage window
- **Refresh tokens** - Maintain UX
- **Backend validation** - Real security

---

## Choose Your Guide

### 👉 [React Authentication](/docs/auth/react)

**Single Page Applications**

**Stack**: React + External API (Node.js/Django/.NET/etc.)

**You'll implement:**

- Secure token storage (memory + httpOnly cookies)
- Automatic token refresh with Axios interceptors
- Optimized permission hooks (prevent re-renders)
- Route protection
- Role & permission-based access

---

### 👉 [Next.js Authentication](/docs/auth/nextjs)

**Server-Rendered Applications**

**Stack**: Next.js App Router + External API

**You'll implement:**

- Auth.js (NextAuth) integration
- Server Component authentication
- Middleware route protection
- Permission checks (server + client)
- Server Actions security

---

## What Makes These Different

✅ **No localStorage/sessionStorage** - Only secure methods  
✅ **Auto token refresh** - Seamless 30-day sessions  
✅ **Permission optimization** - No performance issues at scale  
✅ **Production code** - Copy, paste, ship  
✅ **Backend permissions** - Flexible structure from your API  
✅ **Security first** - Explains WHY, not just HOW

---

## After Completing Either Guide

You'll have:

- ✅ XSS-protected authentication
- ✅ CSRF-mitigated cookies
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Permission-based UI rendering
- ✅ Route protection
- ✅ Production-ready security
